        <h2 class="text-left">Brief Introduction</h2>
        <p>September 09, 2017</p>
        <p>I can't believe we've finally made fourth year after struggling for so so so so ... long. But it's not over yet, they're introducing us to an Eight month project called the "Fourth Year Design Project". It's kinda funny considering we're technically in our fifth year. Regardless, long story short, we're required to make a group of four students and work on a mega project. Being friends since first year - Mihai, Rahul, and I (Mahmubul) - decided we're going to be a team. As I've learned from anime, this can either make us better friends or bitter enemies, only time will tell.</p>

        <h2 class="text-left">First Meeting</h2>
        <p>September 16, 2017</p>
        <p>This week, the team had their first meeting with Professor James Tung, as assistant professor and researcher for the University of Waterloo. My first impressions: "He's really smart! Hopefully he can help us make an amazing project." The meeting was brief, he essentially outlined the project requirements for us.</p>
        <li>We start working now, up until March 2018 (when we have a giant symposium to show off our research)</li>
        <li>We are required to have a team of four, so we need to find someone else</li>
        <li>Encompass hardware, mechanical, software, electrical -> Mechatronics</li>
        <li>They don't really "care" what we do, as long as we can make it unique and super cool</li>
    </div>
    <div id="about" class="bg-primary">
        <h2 class="text-left">New Squad</h2>
        <p>September 23, 2017</p>
        <p>This week, we managed to find a fourth team member, yaaay! His name is Nhat Le and he's a software guru who's working with embedded software and front/backend web development. He's also pretty cool so he'll definitely fit with the team's social dynamic. Now the team is actually pretty versatile: I've got the electrical side, Mihai has the mechanical background, and Rahul has the hardware experience. With a strong team now found, we need to focus on finding a super cool idea. We've got a few, but we need to do a lot more research.</p>
        <br>
        <p>Smart Mirror: The problem we would be trying to solve is fitting issues with online clothes shopping. I've been doing research on trying to create a product for this for a while, so even if we don't do this as a team, I'm probably going to work on it on my own. But the help of three other Engineers does definitely seem awesome. The idea is to capture someone body measurements and create a virtual avatar of them with those same dimensions. Then, clothes would be overlayed on the avatar in order to check the fit. Initial look at the project makes it seem very software heavy and since we only have one software guy, do we really want to pursue it? Moreover, a few similar projects already exist, though none of made it very far into the commercial world. Which is the idea: we would create a product that everyone would want to buy.</p>
        <br>
        <p>Smart Showerhead: The problem we would be trying to solve is water management, which is kind of meta (not unique). Regardless, water is considered the "next oil" and if we can help reduce the amount of water people are required to use, we would definitely be doing our part for the environment. We could make it unique by making it smart and adding: a dynamic temperature control system to allow the user to vary the temperature; an infrared ON/OFF system, so it only turns on when user present; angle control system to allow motion through voice command; and integrate with Alexa/Google Home to allow the use of a voice command. This seems pretty cool, it's very versatile as it'll include mechanical design, hardware control, software development, and electrical management. The only downside is, there are many products like this out there already and some have made it big on the market. Our biggest contribution would be the integration of Alexa as it seems that's not something that's been done before.

        <img src="img/model6.webp" alt="sketch2" style="height: 100px">
        <p>After much deliberation and battle to the death, the team has decided to tackle the Smart Mirror idea. We started out with initial sketches and base ideas, but nothing concrete as of yet:</p>
        <li>Indoor use, residential -> power off 120V AC</li>
        <li>Target audience will be males (research shows they shop the most online)</li>
        <li>Display everything on a 27" ~ 40" TV (need to go in store to see size with our own eyes)</li>
        <li>Need to create or buy a 2Way mirror (must figure out size)</li>
        <li>Capture body sizing using a KinectContraints</li>

  <div id="about" class="white-bg">
    <div class="container">
        <h2 class="text-left">Initialization</h2>
        <p>October 07, 2017</p>
        <p>Further research into the Smart Mirror taught us how little we really know. We need to work hard (ugh). Although, to continue with the project, we should set some basic goals and parameters for the project to help us stay on track.</p>
        <br>
        <p>Team Roles:</p>
        <li>Mahmubul Hoque - Electrical/Project Manager</li>
        <li>Mihai Listov - Mechanical/Software</li>
        <li>Nhat Le - Software/Hardware</li>
        <li>Rahul Sehgal - Hardware/Electrical</li>
        <br>
        <p>Objectives:</p>
        <li>cost less than $400</li>
        <li>24 weeks from idea -> working prototype</li>
        <li>one touch start (as least complicated as possible)</li>
        <li>capture body image of males</li>
        <li>overlay Tshirts, account for stretch</li>
        <li>determine best fit</li>
        <br>
        Constraints:
        <li>dimensions less than 100 x 60 x 10 cm</li>
        <li>run off Windows 10 laptop (so the customer can use their laptop)</li>
        <li>weight less than 10kg (*ince it's a home product, it shouldn't be too heavy)</li>
        <li>hardware accurate to 2" (step size between small, medium, large)</li>
    </div>
    <div class="container">
        <h2 class="text-left">Patents</h2>
        <p>October 14, 2017</p>
        <p>Now that we have some parameters for our goal, we need to work towards making a prototype. Before that though, Tung mentioned we should look into other similar products and see if they have patents. It'll not only help us see what our competitors are doing, which would end up us ideas of what to add/improve, but also ensure we're not "stealing" any ideas. This is mainly because we would (ideally) be patenting our product. According to Nhat who's been focusing on this, there are many patents out there; though mayn seem abandoned and lots use avatars. To get out of the idea of using Avatars, I suggested we use live bodies. So instead of capturing live body dimensions and creating an avatar of the subject, we should just keep their bodies as it is and overlay on that. If we stick to using the Kinect, this won't pose an issue as the data streams support this already.</p>
    </div>
    <div class="container">
        <h2 class="text-left">How?</h2>
        <p>October 21, 2017</p>
        <p>Tung mentioned that we're going to be having a Preliminary Design Presentation to show the research we've done so far. For these, we'll see basic stuff (roles, objectives, contraints, and patents), as well as possible designs and a decision. The team has come up with some great designs so far:</p>
        <br>
        <p>Design 1: Raspberry Pi + Raspberry Camera + Open CV</p>
        <li>low lost</li>
        <li>program Pi, learn Open CV, synchronize camera</li>
        <li>not accurate (Pi cameras aren't the best)</li>
        <br>
        <p>Design 2: Kinect + Windows + Unity</p>
        <li>high cost</li>
        <li>program Kinect, abuse public scripts, learn Unity</li>
        <li>accurate</li>
        <br>
        <p>From what it looks like, the team would rather go with Design 2. In terms of complexity and price, we would be force to put in more effort and money. On the other hand, we would be producing a better product with higher accuracy. We need to consider that we may not be able to patent the product since we're using a Kinect (though we can overcome this if we create our own Kinect?). Moreover, what is Unity? It is essentially software that supports the Kinect and we can use that to import clothing models into it, as well as add flexibility. The clothes will most likely be made on CAD software, such as SolidWorks.</p>
    </div>
    <div class="container">
        <h2 class="text-left">Preliminary Design Presentation Roast</h2>
        <p>October 28, 2017</p>
        <p>So it turns out that either we did not communicate our product correctly or it simply is not a good enough project. I choose to believe the former. Tha main conflictions during the preliminary design prsentation was the fact that it did not encompass enough hardware/mechanical. To overcome this, the team has decided to build an enclosure for the product, which works out better for us at the end of the day. We will have an interactive display that people can play with during the symposium.</p>
        <br>
        <p>Overall, we're going to have an enclosure with a 2Way mirror infront of a TV and Kinect. The Kinect will capture the user's body dimensions and send them to Unity. In the background, Unity will be pulling clothes from Solidworks and putting them into Unity as well. The program will then scale the clothes and display them on the TV, behind the mirror. The user themself will be looking at a reflection of themselves from the mirror with scaled clothes being overlayed on the TV.</p>

        <p>November 11, 2017</p>
        <p>Just like the One Piece hiatus, it was time for our own personal growth. The project foundations were pretty much set, so it was time for everyone to split off into their respective parts. I would focus on electrical, Rahul and Mihai would be focusing on Mechanical, and Nhat would be focusing on Software.</p>
        <br>
        <p>Mahmubul Hoque - Electrical: Power all devices</p>
        <p>Rahul Sehgal/Mihai Listov - Mechanical: Build enclosure to hold all devices</p>

        <h2 class="text-left">Technical</h2>
        <p>November 25, 2017</p>
        <p>From here on, we're going to be posting in a bit more detail so hopefully it doesn't get too boring. We've finally decided on the Smart Mirror Idea, which we've titled AR Fitting. Again, to re-iterate, I will be focusing on Electrical, Rahul+Mihai will be focusing on Mechanical, and Nhat will be focusing on Software. Ofcourse we'll help each other out but in terms of resposiblity, they'll be the Engineers held accountable.</p>
        <h3>Electrical</h3>
        <p>Design 1: Simply plug all the components into a powerbar and have a single wall outlet.</p>
        <li>simplest</li>
        <li>most clutter (# of components)</li>
        <li>most mass due to the additional of individual AC/DC adapters</li>
        <li>most thermal complication due to the work from multiple AC/DC adapters</li>
        <p>Design 2: Replace individual adapters with single PDU</p>
        <li>will require actual Engineering work</li>
        <li>least clutter</li>
        <li>less mass due to removal of multiple AC/DC adapters</li>
        <li>less thermal complication as the PDU will be producing most of the heat</li>
        <br>
        <p>While I could make my life easy by doing Design 1, I'd like to follow Design 2. It would allow me to treat the project as an actual product, rather than "another assignment that I just want to finish". In order to move forward with it, I'll need to do a bit of the following:</p>
        <br>
        <p>Firstly, I'll need to ensure each device is receiving a proper voltage input in order to allow it to produce enough power to run. From the looks of it, I'll require a combination of 3V, 5V, and 12V DC for the PC components; though these are universal inputs so there's little to worry about when choosing between various components. For the TV, it'll require a 12V DC input. One thing I'll need to consider is that some TVs come with internal adapters, so there's only an AC outlet. Even if this is the case, it'll be one less thing to build a circuit for. The Kinect requires a 19V input and from initial outlooks, I'll probably use a boost converter; little power loss while being cheap.</p>
        <br>
        <p>Secondly, I'll need to consider whether I should make my own PDU or buy one. Building my own will allow me to control the inputs, interarior circuitry, and number of outputs; as well as allow me to flex my Electrical engineering knowledge. On the other hand, I'll need to put in additional effort, worry about receiving CSA approval, and possible make a mistake -> break the entire product (fingers crossed this does not happen). If I were to buy one, I would not have control of the PDU, but most PDUs produce the 3V, 5V, and 12V outputs we require, as well as contains built-in relays to ensure safety in case of power surges. Moreover, they would be CSA approved so it would be one less hassle to deal with. The team agrees it will be better to buy one, but we'll see.</p>
        <h3>Mechanical</h3>
        <p>For the enclosure, we'll need to figure out proper sizing, materials, and shape for the design. In terms of sizing, the entire enclosure will need to be big enough to fit a full size mirror (so the user can see their entire body), as well as a 40" TV, Kinect, and various computer components. In terms of materials, we will need to ensure the enclosure is as light as possible, yet able to support individual components. The reason mass is prioritized is because we are hoping this is an at-home product and no customer would want to carry around a heavy product. Mihai proposes we use balsa wood for the experior as it is very light. One problem is that balsa would is generally used as carving wood so it may not be able to support the mass of all components. Further solidworks research will need to be done. Rahul suggests we use alumunum for the back to keep the option of mounting open. The team agrees, but we will need to put in additional work to bend the alunimum if it comes down to it. Moreover, we will need to find a vendor for the 2Way mirror. Finally, in terms of shape, we will need to mimic a common household mirror; meaning it will either be an oval or square shape. Since there's going to be a rectangular monitor inside, we will most likely go towards a rectangular share; though additional solidworks analysis needs to be done.</p>
        <h3>Software</h3>
        <p>Nhat has download the Kinect SDK and already began playing around with it. It seems to be very user friendly and there is a large online community in case we need scripts or help with specific issues. Luckily there aren't many decisions that need to be made for the software, it's all a matter of just coding and continuing to code.</p>

            <div class="col-sm-6">
                <p>As seen on the left, the circuit is very simple. What we have is a simple 120V AC from one's power outlet to the PSU (power supply). From the PSU, the 3V, 5V, and 12V lines will be sent to the PC parts (though it doesn't show the 12V, it's there, I just got lazy). A parallel line from the 12V is taken and sent to the Kinect sensor. Another parallel line is taken from the 12V and sent to a boost converter, which outputs the 19V required for most TVs. Given a 25% redundancy factor, the components require a total of 400W -> we require a 400W PSU. Further research will need to be done, but this design will support the most important systems. I'd also like to put in additional research into backlights (since we are using a 2Way mirror), USB-inputs, etc; just to give additional "nice-to-haves" for the product.</p>
            </div>

        <h3>Mechanical</h3>

            <p>These are the initial models that had been built in Solidworks. As one can see, it is a simple rectangular, wooden enclosure. The TV is support by two 2x4s, which are loaded onto the frame. The Kinect rests an thin plank of wood underneath the TV because the Kinect yields the best results when it is at waist level. Finally, the computer components are placed at the bottom to lower the center of gravity and prevent too much bending at the top from the TV. Finally, the mirror is glued infront of all of these. Solidworks analysis states that balsa wood is able to support all the of mass. Moreover, in order to perform thermal analysis of the computer components, we will need to find a thermal gun or probes; this will be done later.</p>
        <h3>Software</h3>

                <p>Nhat has figured out the basic workflow that works best for our project. Firstly, the Kinect capture the body of the user and sends it to the SDK. From here, the data streams are filtered so only the body proportions are held. Simultaneously, clothing from solidworks are pulled into Unity and send to me process along with the body proportions. The final image to be output on the monitor is the scaled clothing along with a recommendation of fit.</p>

        <p>January 13, 2017</p>
        <p>Hey guys, we're back! Along with that, we've made purchases for our project. This is what's been done so far:</p>
        <h3>Electrical</h3>
            <li>obtained free Kinect from Tung</li>
            <li>purchased 500W PSU off Amazon</li>
            <li>purchased 40" TV at Best Buy aka take advantage of Boxing Day Salez</li>
        <h3>Mechanical</h3>
            <li>purchased wood for frame</li>
            <li>free tools from Mihai's dad</li>
            <li>purchased nuts and bolts</li>
        <h3>Software</h3>
            <p>Nhat's got the first prototype of the product done! Here's a video of what it looks like:</p>
            <video width="320" height="240" controls>

        <p>January 27, 2017</p>
        <h3>Electrical</h3>
        <p>Some major revisions have been made to the electrical side of the project. Firstly, the team had voted on not purchasing PC components to be put into the enclosure. While this would best replicate what the final product would look like, it increases our budget significantly. So instead, we will just run the software off one of our laptops. If anything, we could market this strategy as a cheaper alternative; rather than buy an all-in-one enclosure, buy one minus the computer parts and save money by using your own computer to run the software. The only downside would be those customers that do not have the hardware that is required to run the arduous computations.</p>
